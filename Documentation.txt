- - Decrease the current cell by 1.
> - Turn the pointer to east.
< - Turn the pointer to west.
^ - Turn the pointer to north.
v - Turn the pointer to south.
L - Move into previous cell.
R - Move into next cell.
A - Pop the next cell and add with the current cell.
M - Pop the next cell and subtract with the current cell.
P - Pop the next cell and multiply with the current cell.
D - Pop the next cell and divide by it from the current cell.
S - Skip a next command.
I - If the current cell is not 0, then skip a next command.
. - Input to the cell from a character.
, - Output from the cell to a character.
@ - End program.

M - Do A-B when setting in current pop mode.
P - Do AB when setting in current pop mode.
D - Do A/B when setting in current pop mode.
/ - Do mod(A,B) when setting in current pop mode.
